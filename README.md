# React - Forms Exercise 2 - Todo App
Simple "todo list" app. This gave me practice using controlled components, particularly forms, in React. User can submit a todo list item and

  <img width="90%" src="todo.png" alt="Image of app">
</p>

## Running the App
1) Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/mpike91/React-FormsExercise2.git`
2) Move into directory: `cd React-FormsExercise2/`
3) Install npm: `npm install`
4) Start app: `npm start`

## My Contribution
No starter code was given to me. Only component names and their functionality was described to me as an assignment. I wrote everything myself, on top of the create-react-app boilerplate.
